You've probably seen a few types of symmetry already. This chapter will look at some examples in geometry that you've likely seen, and a few you might not have seen, and look at them in a way that you perhaps haven't thought of them before.

\section{Beyond Two Dimensions}
It's worth mentioning that you can do all of this classification work in three dimensions (or any other number you like), but it quickly gets somewhat out of hand: in three dimensions, instead of the 17 Wallpaper Groups, there are 230 Crystallographic Groups. Beyond that, it gets even more silly (there are 4,894 in dimension 4, 222,097 in 5 dimensions, and nobody even knows how many there are in dimension 6, but it's definitely more than 28,927,915).
